                <h3>Join us as a Volunteer!</h3>
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>

                <h3>From micro-organisms to the human body.</h3>
                <p>Major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
